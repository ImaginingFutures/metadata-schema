IF-LAB-0001,"Baddawi Camp Lab, Lebanon",,,,,,,,,,,Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh;Yousif M. Qasmiyeh,,https://imaginingfutures.world/labs/baddawi-lebanon/,,accessible to public,,,,,
IF-LAB-0002,"Beirut, Lebanon",,,,,City as Archive | Archiving a City | The Imagined as Un-Archiving a City,"As part of the Imagining Futures project, the Beirut Urban Lab at the American University of Beirut will house the Beirut Lab, a lab that will interrogate the methods and strategies in which Beirut has been archived and unarchived. This comes with the understanding of the city as a complex, dynamic process of archiving and unarchiving; a contested entity with an open process of multiple realities, narratives and futures. The lab further explores how moments of disruption trigger the unarchiving of the city towards an imagined future. 

The unfolding of recent events since October 2019 has called for the rethinking the city as an archive, archiving the city, and imagined as un-archiving the city. The October 17th Revolution pushed people onto the streets of central Beirut, reclaiming expropriated structures and reinitiating socio-spatial practices. The collapse of the Lebanese economy, the devaluation of the national currency and the spread of Covid-19 throughout the spring brought social and economic life in the city to an end and plunged large sections of Lebanon’s population into poverty. On August 4th, a stockpile of ammonium nitrate precariously stored at the Beirut Port for 6 years exploded with the ferocity of small atomic bomb, shattering entire neighborhoods and upending countless lives. 

As part of the Beirut Urban Lab’s response to these events, the Beirut Lab will explore how different conceptions of reconstruction and recovery can function as processes of unarchiving. It looks at the public as an agency of imagining the future through socio-spatial tactics of the revolution after October 2019 and then through the oral narratives crafted for the future of a recovery after the Port’s blast.","The lab explores post-disaster relief as a producer of archives, moments of disruptions as un-archiving processes, and reconstructions as methods of unarchiving multiple imaginaries using the perception of heritage across time as a primary frame. The Beirut lab’s objective is to A) Uncover, document, archive and unarchive social, physical and intangible histories of Beirut. B) To read through maps and masterplans not only as tools of urban change, but as systems that deconstruct the dichotomy between the organization of territory, and the potential for geographic and social rupture. C) To analyze the production of space on an urban level, or the lack thereof, by studying the strategies and methods through which the state attempted to plan Beirut, and subsequently failed. D) To visualize alternative urban histories and to present new historical and social readings of Beirut’s urban form, it’s architectural ‘landmarks’ and the diverse practices of its inhabitants. E) The lab will also present critical readings of the agency and methodologies behind various Beiruti reconstructions; from the Solidere project, to Beit Beirut, to the anticipated, and imagined, reconstruction and recovery of the Bachoura, Gemmayze, Mar Mikhael, Karantina and Ain Mreisse following the August 4 explosion.  

The lab will rely on visualization and mapping, analysing public and cultural centers archives of the city, and developing the Levant carta platform as the main research tools.","Urban Recovery at the Intersection of Displacement and Reconstruction- City debates April 2019, AUB

IF-LAB-0003,The London Lab,,,,,,"The mobile virtual London Lab is a collaboration between CSM, with colleagues Mick Finch, Louisa Minkin and Elizabeth Wright, and the Endangered Material Knowledge Programme at the British Museum, led by Ceri Ashley (also of the University of Pretoria, S. Africa). It pools expertise and a network of knowledge, supporting the 4 context- Labs and the commissioning stage. It will focus on provision of digital toolkits and skill-sharing through non-hierarchical forms, grassroots production, using free/libre open-source software (FLOSS), with the intention of developing new contexts and associations and strategies for egalitarian archiving practice, enabling new self-representations and re-reading or counter-mapping of existing archival material. It will include such digital practices as: Mazi Raspberry Pi technology (low cost hyper local networking for community self-representation), film auto-documentation and ELAN software for annotations, and a suite of open source solutions for photogrammetric capture and post-processing. The emphasis will be on digital recording/capture of sites, places, landscape and 3D objects and surfaces, and the intersection of these with lived and re-lived memories and futurities – tools of both production and dissemination. It aims to enable events that will experiment with a set of media familiar in art schools: video, sound, animation, 3D structure from motion photogrammetry and geo-spatial applications but also in terms of the use of analogue media; and interfaces with EMKP’s proven record of supporting research in digital/visual ethnography, audio-visual creation, innovative and reflexive metadata organisation, multi-layered annotation, safeguarding, situational ethics and intellectual property rights, the practicalities of digital holding and access curation. Prior work project partners’ work includes re-tooling colonial and historic photographic and object archives held in museums through repatriation to source communities and working with knowledge holders of the Blackfoot Confederacy concerning their objects in UK collections. Through such interventions, older hieratic understandings and appropriation of knowledge becomes re-purposed for new engagements and archival creation. Existing knowledge structures, whether local to ODA- countries or existing skills of London team-members, are starting points for collective sharing and knowledge development.","We have met with several of the Labs and are hoping to have met them all by the end of 2020.  The Lab is establishing dialogue to explore the specificities of each Lab, their methods, technologies and the challenges they are encountering during COVID 19. The Lab is working on a case study with the community of an adventure playground in London in the production of a mural.  An older mural will be archived and the production of the new mural documented toward the production of toolkits that relate to both digital and analogue processes. The aim here is develop strategies that respond to the contexts of the Labs in terms of pragmatic encounters, as examples to work with the Labs as their projects unfold. ","As soon as we have the material from our case study we will lead an event on its material, insights and outcomes that we will present to our colleagues in Imagining Futures. We are aiming for December 2020 for this event.","On-going dialogue with the labs
