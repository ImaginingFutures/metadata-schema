UFC0001,Yucatan to Living and archiving Sotuta’s foodways,Phase 2 Projects - Commissions (Sep 2022-Sep 2023),Central and South America,UFC0001,,"Our project integrated archiving into the everyday life of Sotuta, a Maya community in Yucatan, Mexico. Over a year, fourteen residents, almost all women from a wide age range, documented the foodways of the town, involving their family members, friends, and neighbours. Each chose the topic they would document, which included medicinal and culinary recipes, kitchen gardens, the wilderness, the relationship between humans and plants and animals, agricultural practices, festivities and traditions, and memories of past life experiences, among others. Together, they collected over 4000 images, videos, and handwritten documents, they restored a mural documenting Sotuta’s embroiderers, cross-stitched calendars, embroidered memory journals, and hand sewed dolls. They created the multimedia archive by incorporating their record collection into their routines. That is, they integrated self-archiving into their life, firmly positioning themselves as historical actors through the quiet processes of the everyday. Through regular meetings, community workshops, and an exhibition, in partnership with with local grassroots projectCultiva Alternativas de Regeneración, Solares Huertas Agroforestales,andComunidad escuela campesina de agricultura regenerativa y agroforestería Maya,we also created spaces of intergenerationaltsikbal, intimate dialogue, to share experiences, records, memories, and emotions, reinforcing collective memory. With this, the project intertwined the tangible with the intangible. Living and archiving Sotuta’s foodways has helped revitalise sustainable practices for food sovereignty and the defence of Maya identity, memory, territory, and ways of living","Through workshops that will follow the Tzolk’in count of 260 days (the time it takes for corn to mature), the community will gestate a transmedia archive from text, audio, video, and image with memory objects, such as embroideries, and interventions in public spaces. The archive seeks to be a source of inspiration, reflection, and agency, and it will be a central tool in the regenerative agroforestry school and the women’s kitchen gardens initiative for food sovereignty as they counter the threats of climate change, urbanisation, poverty, migration and the abandonment of agricultural and culinary practices. With this, we seek to foster a way of experiencing the present, with a consciousness of its ties to the past, and an understanding of how one can shape the future.","In December 2022, we held an open community workshop to diagnose and self-reflect on the current state of memory-keeping and set the direction, parameters, and objectives of the project. This was followed up by another workshop in March 2023 to evaluate, reflect upon, and adjust the course of action. Finally, in November 2023, we presented the results in an exhibition open to the public to collectively analyse and systematise experiences and celebrate results. These community events allowed us to trace collective paths to reinvigorate locally grounded alternative and sustainable practices both through action and through memory work.","Record collection took place in the quotidian life of the participants. They then met regularly over home-cooked meals consisting of traditional dishes and ingredients grown by the participants themselves. The meals opened a space of tsikbal to troubleshoot problems, learn from each other and get inspired. As their projects evolved, participants reported a transformation in their understanding of maintaining their foodways alive, acknowledging their roles as historical actors, and gaining tools to continue to do so. They also observed tangible changes in their lives, with individuals implementing newfound knowledge, such as using medicinal plants or altering agricultural practices, as well as gaining a sense of appreciation for their knowledge, experiences, and wisdoms, as well as that of others.",,Olin Moctezuma Burns,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/animating-cycles-for-living-and-archiving-the-foodways-of-a-maya-community-in-yucatan/,,accessible to public,,,,,

This project is aimed at protecting cultural traditions of the Luo Community of western Kenya - folklores, riddles and traditional music. Folklores, riddles and music were at the heart of Luo cultural heritage. Folklores were about heroic selfless acts which bestowed in younger people a deep sense of community service, riddles were primarily for entertainment and bringing people together and traditional music was used to celebrate good harvests, mourn the dead and celebrate victories of whatever kind.","A country like Kenya has ethnic diversity which in most cases breeds negative ethnicity.  One of the long-term aims of this project is to use the output to encourage better ethnic tolerance and enhanced cultural understanding.

UFC0004,"Archiving the endangered traditional herbal medicinal knowledge and practices among multi-ethnic groups in Songea District, Southern Tanzania",Phase 1 Projects - Commissions (2021-2022),,UFC0004,,"Traditional African medicine (TAM) was an advanced sector in the continent during the pre-colonial era. During colonial era Europeans assaulted its development as a step towards installation of total spectrum imperialism. Consequently, TAM was not archived as heritage for the present and future generations to benefit from. Thepost-colonial environment of colonial-oriented policies and legislations as well as economic constraints was another obstacle towards archiving TAM knowledge and practices. Contemporary land use and western-oriented geopolitical dragnet and changes generally marketed in the name of modernity continue to threaten TAM. This project is an effort to document and sustain TAM as an important African heritage. The project focuses ontraditional herbal medicinal knowledge and practicesinSongeadistrict, Ruvuma region, southern Tanzania.","First, the project documents various diseases commonly known among the local people that are cured traditionally using plant-based medicines. This is achieved through oral interviews with members of the local communities and herbalists. Second, the project identifies and documents all medicinal plant species the local herbalists and communities use to cure various diseases. This is done through ethnobotanical survey guided by local herbalists. Third, the project determines the spatial variability of endangered medicinal plants and human land uses that threatens the plants through GIS spatial analyses. Finally, the project documents the established procedures for preparing and administering various identified traditional herbal medicines. This aspect is captured through demonstration by local herbalists. ",In December 2020 we attended and participated in the workshop/meeting organised and coordinated by Drs. Valence Silayo and Nancy Rushohora of the Imagining Features Tanzania Lab that aimed to bring together the Imagining Futures awardees to share knowledge and experience.

We propose living archives as a decolonial methodology to re-centre life to imagine forms of living heritage based on relational forms of thinking and being. This approach accounts for the everyday interactions, the polyphony of (hi)stories and the multiplicity of spatial practices often silenced.

UFC0017,Digitization of Herbarium Collections from the College of African Wildlife Management to Enhance Learning and Research,Phase 2 Projects - Commissions (Sep 2022-Sep 2023),Africa,UFC0017,,"Despite the wealth of Mweka Herbarium (hosted at the College of African Wildlife Management, Mweka) in terms of botanical collection (with > 6000 specimen), the collection has been for more than half a decade limited to physical access for research and education. This situation exposed the collection under serious threats of deterioration and/ loss while undocumented because of attack by pests, aging, unfavourable weather, and physical handling. Additionally, physical access hinders remote access by users for research and educational purposes. Therefore, this project seeks to improve preservation and access of botanical specimens deposited at Mweka Herbarium for research and education by wide range of users without risking the quality of the original specimens. The overall outcome of having 6000 specimens annotated, imaged and databased was achieved by digitizing a total of 6020 herbarium specimens comprising of 1746 species belonging to 646 genera and 158 families. The commonest genus was Cyperus (3.9%; n=232), and the family was Poaceae (n=1302). Further result showed that 92% of specimens were collected from Tanzania and the remaining 8% from Kenya since 1960 to early 2000 with the peak collection recorded in 1968. When the globalextinction risk status of each plant species obtained during digitization was evaluated using IUCN Red List of Threatened Species results showed most species were categorized as “Not Evaluated”. However, 36 species were found under the category of species facing high risks of extinction led by species under genus Aloe followed by Euphorbia. On the other hand, the project managed to create a dataset of 6020 georeferenced botanical specimens following a DarwinCore Archive (DwC-A) standards for publication into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In terms of enhancing professionalism, the project strengthened the capacity of biodiversity technicians and academic staff botanical collection management, digitization workflow and application of natural history databases in data management. Additionally, through this project we created a new collection of 729 specimens of ethnobotanical and conservation significance. This project was critical not only in transforming Mweka Herbarium into the digital ages but also improving preservation of original collections, and remote access of the digital copies by a wider community for research and education popularization.

This project draws on approaches in contemporary archaeology to witness and document COVID-19 materiality - posters, signage, murals, graffiti, discarded personal protective equipment, disinfection paraphernalia, barricades - on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam through photographs and sketches to create a fully accessible online archive of COVID-19 heritage. The project is timely. As lockdowns fade from memory, debates are ongoing as to how the extraordinary period of pandemic will be remembered. Meanwhile, material traces of pandemic are beginning to disappear as daily life resumes under ‘new normal’ conditions. Our research seizes the opportunity not only to create an open access archive of COVID-19 heritage but to test the extent to which material perspectives in research on disasters can improve understandings of the relationships between public action and government policies.","Methodological tools to document unexpected, ephemeral events and investigate the social dynamics of disasters and disaster recovery are lacking. This study uses a mixed methods approach incorporating ethnographic, archaeological and arts-based methods to create an ‘archive from below’ that acknowledges alternative visions of the past and may offer a counterpoint to official narratives. Through informal conversations, semi-structured interviews and potentially through extended ethnographic encounters, the three research team members will engage with city dwellers who interface with transient COVID-19 materiality to understand the social meaning they ascribe to it. By employing visual arts practices - sketching, painting, photography - we stretch the meaning of archive and engage non-academic audiences. And in creating a social media repository, we will be developing an innovative mode of archival practice that accommodates diverse community experiences of pandemic.

To film interview sessions with video native producers. To place all data on an online repository.,To be confirmed,"To say that analogue video production is the precursor of cinematic pluralism and independence in Ghana is an understatement. Video technology brought diversity and democratized the film production industry. By the beginning of the 1990’s, large quantum of video films produced by budding video filmmakers had positioned it as a dominant popular culture in Ghana. Titles such asand hundred other titles visually expressed important aspects of the experiences and dreams of the middle- and lower-class members of the Ghanaian society yet, these titles are currently merely a faint memory as there is almost no access to contents. Zinabu, Kanana, Sika Sunsum, Diabolo, Who Killed Nancy, Step Dad Pioneer video filmmakers in Ghana have their cultural products on analogue formats such as VHS, SUPER-VHS and BETACAM. These formats are believed to contain contents that resonates with the Ghanaian socio-cultural memories. Regardless,the contents are trapped in these outdated formats. This projectwasenvisaged to collect, digitize and place on an accessible repository, analogue video native films produced between the early 1980’s tolate1990’sjust before digital video came onto the Ghanaian scene. The focus on analogue video native works is because we view those materials to be at risk of total destruction, as the era of its height of usage was faced with limited technology for preservation of materials. Participating video pioneers readily welcomed the project and collaborated fully by providing copies of their films and participating in video interviewed on their body of work. Most of the participants were men with only one woman who worked as a producer and sometime, production manager. Most of the films received from them were in a destructive stage. For instance, out of the over 40 video films produced by Socrates Safo the team collected only 8 copies from him and most were beyond salvage. Regardless, some have been salvaged and placed on an accessible website. This is an ongoing project aimed at bringing alive, the contents of analogue video films which we consider to be at the most risk of total destruction. The channel will however expand to incorporate all other films and formats of archival importance to Ghanaians and beyond. https://ghfilmarchive.com",,Rebecca Ohene-Asah,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/ghanas-analogue-video-film-digitization-archiving-and-repository-project/,,accessible to public,,,,,
UFC0024,Embracing the past: Professionals and Indigenous People Dialogue on Historical Sites in Southern Tanzania,Start Up Projects (2020-2021),,UFC0024,,"Tanzanian professional historians and heritage experts have taken an active position in explaining the wealth and importance of historical and heritage sites. Alongside these professionals is another group of people operating in the name of ‘tour guides’ whose responsibility is to tell stories about the sites and the material collections therein. These professional practitioners have expropriated the voices of local communities by taking over the duty of narrating the past. It has been revealed in this project that local communities who are the custodians of the histories of the sites have been marginalized when it comes to the narration of their own past. Whatever professionals consider important about the sites may not necessarily be important in the perspectives of the local communities. During focus group discussions with indigenous people living around the sites, it was noted that local communities are not satisfied with the professional operationalization of the sites. They feel isolated from not only telling about their past but also in the conservation and management of the sites.   The on-site dialogue between professionals and the local community came up with a multiplicity of voices from both sides as to what they think are the better ways of having a common understanding of the histories/stories about the sites. Also discussed was on having additional information and traditional materials to the existing histories from local communities especially traditional connoisseurs. It was observed that there is a lot of sensitive stories from the indigenous community that are out of sight from the professional outlook.","The Objective of the activity is to create not only a forum for discussion on matters about the past based on the material expressions at the site but also negotiated knowledge generation from below that would be archived and transferred to the next generation. In tandem with the Imagining future objectives, the dialogue at the site (s) will also enhance memorization and agreement about the past and how the present and the future are true reflections of the past. By engaging local communities who are undoubtedly marginalized from their own past, the project would re-shape our understanding of exactly are the histories and stories told about the sites and how are the sites connected to the indigenous people around. Or, what else is of more historical and cultural importance according to local communities than the sites as historical landscapes. The economic benefit of the sites to the local communities is another issue of concern in this study. Methodologically, the project was conducted in the framework of community archaeology, seeking to capture and archive local voices about their heritages to which they are custodians. Project participants, both professionals, and local community representatives had a dialogue in form of interviews and focus group discussions, leading to a consensus/dissensus on the questions under discussion. The aim was among others to create common grounds between professionals and local communities concerning the interpretation of and which history/story matters about the past.",,,,Festo W.

UFC0025,"Archiving 30,000 years of eruptive history to raise volcanic risk awareness in Arequipa, Peru",Phase 2 Projects - Commissions (Sep 2022-Sep 2023),Central and South America,UFC0025,,"Arequipa (Peru) is a highly vulnerable city in the face of volcanic hazards, exposed to potential devastating explosive activity of Misti volcano. Yet risk awareness is extremely low, as nobody has in mind a recent eruption. During its past activity, Misti volcano has deposited layers of volcanic products that can be partially found in different parts of the territory. In 2022, the construction of a road uncovered an incredible and unique ~5-meters high outcrop with 21 layers of deposits, which represent the last 30.000 last years of Misti activity. Presented to the public, this outcrop will be a unique opportunity to raise risk awareness on both the magnitude and the frequency of the Misti explosive eruptions, and thus to better engage with disaster reduction measures.","Our goal has been to archive this outcrop to preserve it after its discovery in 2022 and before it may be severely degraded by the rainy season from January 2023,as it ismade of very loose material that may not have survived heavy rains. To do this, we have impregnated the stratigraphic deposits by “painting” the outcrop with an epoxy resin. Once dried, the epoxy formed hard plates that could be removed for relocation. We will produce audio-visual contents describing the archival process and the outcrop itself, with different levels of understanding (from very basic description to high jargon for students and geology specialists). The audiovisual content will be an interactive reading guide to the epoxy outcrop on display in the museum, available on a screen located near the outcrop and online through a QR code. It will allow the scientist and risk managers to better communicate with the public to raise risk awareness, which is essential to be better prepared to deal with a future eruption in Arequipa.","Inauguration with stakeholders and the public, with realisation of a survey to understand how the information is received and could be improved (by February 2024, INDECI museum and INGEMMET in Arequipa) We are thinking about a transfer of skills between Peruvian and Nicaraguan colleagues who wish to develop this method in their country. This should take the form of a field visit, the terms of which are under discussion.","We stored the epoxy plates in a hangar of the Civil Protection of Arequipa (INDECI), where work is in progress to harmonize their format in order to fix them on the exhibition supports. The exhibition at the INGEMMET observatory is to be inaugurated in December 2023. The INDECI Museum exhibition will be ready only later in 2024 (as the entire showroom is modified to accommodate the sections, and the whole scientific information updated at the same time). In parallel, more tests are ongoing with various epoxy resins to see which the best allows to ‘capture’ stratigraphic deposits. Audio-visual contents have been created during the November-December 2022 fieldwork. Their editing and formatting is in progress (it will be ready by December 2023 to be displayed alongside the outcrop).",,Julie Morin,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/archiving-30000-years-of-eruptive-history-to-raise-volcanic-risk-awareness-in-arequipa-peru/,,not accessible to public,,,,,

Previously funded by the American Philosophical Society, it is led by a joint team of Euro-American and Indigenous Mexican scholars and stakeholders. The project reimagines what an archive is, could be, and should be through re-assembling and transforming the ethnographic and historical knowledge extracted from Mitla through a combination of transcription, translation, and innovative visual methodologies that emphasize Indigenous ontologies (worldviews).","First, the project translates English ethnographic and historical texts into Spanish and Indigenous Zapotec, making those texts freely available to Indigenous community members. Second, it supports travel to an archive in Mexico that holds Mitleño visual heritage (photographs) in order to acquire access and scan materials for return. Third, it centres an Indigenous perspective by crafting a community-curated map linking historical knowledge and selected images to their associated landmarks across Mitla. Fourth, it supports a series of townhall meetings to share these images and documents and discuss the final content of the digital map. The project results in an Indigenous-curated exhibition of historic and ethnographic photography of Mitla at the town’s Pitao Bezelao Cultural Centre.","18 - 29 October 2022: Mitla’s International Festival of Murals, hosted by the Pitao Bezelao Cultural Centre.

Read the full article by Katja Rejon . here","From October 2022 to March 2023, we will continue our work transcribing and translating papers from the Elsie Clews Parsons archive from English into both Spanish and Zapotec with the aid of two commissioned local Mitleño translators. Alongside this, we will also be repatriating historic and ethnographic photos back to the community from the American Philosophical Society and Fototeca (in Pachucha, Mexico), as well as several other cultural institutions and repositories.  From March 2023 to June 2023, the team will convene in Mitla. First, Leathem, Ramón Celis, and Méndez will conduct a collaborative survey or ‘reconnaissance’ of the town, re-incorporating Indigenous Zapotec names of various historic landmarks and places of deep significance into the community-curated map. They will then host several town hall meetings where the community will respond and continue to steward the creation of the map. Project Update: ‘In addition to the translation work of our project, during the last few months we’ve completed several of the sixrecorridos. Framed as a kind of community-led reconnaissance, the recorridos foreground the ways Indigenous epistemologies, cosmologies, and ontologies are anchored in and articulate with place. After inviting local stewards from Mitla’s cultural institutions to accompany us on a recorrido of their choice, we visited multiple places of deep significance found across Mitla and its peripheral lands. They shared the Indigenous Zapotec names for sacred caverns and geological formations, while Co-Investigator Guillermo Ramón Celis took geographic coordinates for each feature and site, formally embedding the Zapotec language into Google Earth. For the project, this is a step in the right direction; until now, Oaxaca’s landscapes - as is the case across much of Mexico, an ostensibly settler-colonial state - bore Spanish names from the language of the colonizers. While the poet Patrick Kavanaugh might have asked, ‘Is naming not a love act?’, naming is also an act of power, woven into systems of historical erasure, displacement, and dispossession. Formally re-inscribing Mitla’s lands and sacred sites with their Zapotec names aids decolonial efforts. It is an act of re-possession and reclamation. So, too, the recorridos provide important data that allows us to achieve the goal of visually linking digitally repatriated photos and ethnographic texts to these significant cultural sites. We hope that by creating these visual linkages, it will reinforce the ways knowledge and landscape, meaning and place, are inextricably entwined. Knowledge has sedimented overtime into an emotively-inflected, complex stratigraphy that reflects myriad temporal orders. Meaning is deposited in the land, made accessible through walks with designated custodians.’ - Hilary Morgan V. Leathem        Photo Credits: Pedro Guillermo Ramón Celis and Hilary Morgan V.

UFC0027,History Closer to the Ngoni People,Phase 2 Projects - Commissions (Sep 2022-Sep 2023),Africa,UFC0027,,"The Ngoni people are one of the most popular Bantu ethnic group in Southern Tanzania.  The majority of current inhabitants of the city of Songea and its environs consider themselves as Ngoni with a long history of political integration, leadership, and migration from Southern Africa (Ebner 1987/2009, Redmond 1985). Songea, however, is also the capital of Tanzania’s Ruvuma Region, which comprises roughly 1.4 Million inhabitants within 64,300 square kilometres. In Songea, regional history has been of particular interest in academic debates since the late 1950s (Mapunda/Mpangara 1969, Mapunda 2010) while current research focuses on the region’s economic and gender history (Kinunda 2019). The Benedictine Abbey of Peramiho was founded as early as 1898 by German missionaries from the Missionary Benedictine Central Abbey St. Ottilien in Bavaria (Hölzl 2021, Egger 2016, Doerr 1998, Napachihi 1998) and it is still part of the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines, which is still one of the largest religious organization of the Catholic Church that spans across the globe. Despite of much research which has been conducted about these folk, very little has been done to present this ethnic group on the ownership of their historical and cultural values as an instrument or bridge for building a new society basing on equality, peace, social and economic development of the Region. The over emphasis or identification of these folk with the war has created for generations the situation of insecurity, lack of confidence, lack of innovation, increase of historical biasness and wrong expectation in the building of the Sustainable Development of the Ngoni people of Songea. Therefore, it is now the high time to shape this society and rid them of such traumatic events.  Through their original Principle of Majengenelu which is the expression of cultural values of assimilation or integration policy in the society and brings people to each other, closer to their History and makes them own their History. The History and Archival Materials which are available in the Archive of Peramiho Abbey will help this society to attain Sustainable Development. By accessing and using these materials through training of 10  History teachers from different Secondary schools around Archives of Peramiho on the important of the local history through the available archival materials, translating of the archival materials into songs, traditional dances, local music, drama, poets and poems to the schools and local communities of Songea will build this society and attain Sustainable Development.","The main goal of this research is to translate and digitalize the archival documents of German Language in Peramiho Abbey Archives into Swahili and English on Ngoni Cultural Values of Majengenelu and use them for public the use by training History Teachers, archivist and making it accessible to the public through traditional dances, Music, Songs, poets, poems and drama in the schools and different events in Songea. The direct contact with people is the key to participatory research. The methods which will be applied include Visit and Meeting to the Centres which are considered to have the remaining materials of the Archives, workshops with the selected groups, interviews, study tours and quality work in the Archives. The “Mayeuticer” approach will be applied. This is the relationship between the Midwife and a pregnant woman.

UFC0028,"Food, Hospitality, and the Micro-cultures of Syria",Start Up Projects (2020-2021),,UFC0028,,"This is a pilot project for a much bigger one on the everyday micro-cultures of Syria, and the importance of studying and archiving them for any post-war reconciliation and society rebuilding efforts.
In this project, we intend to collect data (audio-visual) on food and hospitality rituals that are unique to multiple regional and ethnic groups in Syria that are usually under-represented, misrepresented, or altogether excluded in mainstream media and culture in Syria. The findings will be archived creatively and shared online, and they will inform the writing of a unique Syrian recipe book with a cultural twist. Each entry in the book will include recipes, a historical and cultural background about the dish and the specific social group associated with it, and a narration of any rituals associated with the dish or to this particular group and food.
The mapping out of the research field has already started by the research assistant in Syria so that when the project starts officially in April she will have a clear idea about which cultural groups to focus on and which participants she’d like to interview and film.
Simultaneously, the lead researcher in Exeter will be creating a literature review of scholarly work and studies around food and culture, and then when both this and the data collection in Syria end, he will start writing the cultural recipe book and aim to finish it in September.","There is a severe lack of inclusivity and representation in mainstream Syrian culture due to decades of governmental policies that prohibited any talk of ethnic, religious, or regional differences in the name of unity. This, however, created a society whose different elements are dangerously ignorant of each other, often secretive, and highly mistrustful, and ready to accept myth and dehumanizing stereotypes about the different ‘other.’ We believe that this was a significant factor that contributed to the quick and tragic escalation of the war in Syria as it has made large sections of society easily fear-mongered, manipulated, and recruited in this war directly or indirectly. The media coverage of the war (local, regional and international) has only furthered this ignorance and breathed more life into it, either due to political affiliation or pure incompetent journalism, and the opposing political and military factions capitalized on this and deepened the division. These divisions are religious, sectarian, ethnic, regional, classist, and even divisions of urban vs rural. 

We believe that the only hope of reconciliation and sustainable peace in a post-war Syria is through building cultural competence about the different components of the Syrian nation. By knowing more about each other’s cultures we find points of similarity, find richness and beauty in differences, and we normalize conversations about each other’s rituals and where they cross-over or are unique. The best way to start these conversations is with the daily aspects of these cultures, like food and hospitality.

The research assistant will carry out recorded interviews in Syria where families from very diverse backgrounds. The interviewees will cook and share recipes, they will eat together and introduce any culturally-specific eating and hosting rituals, and will chat about their community and their food traditions. The findings will then be archived creatively and shared online, as well as in a book",,,,Aqeel Abdulla,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/food-hospitality-and-the-micro-cultures-of-syria/,,accessible to public,Discover the book with the interactive map;Send your own recipe,https://create.ifrepo.world/exhibits/syria_recipes_and_cultures;https://create.ifrepo.world/exhibits/syria_recipes_and_cultures/contrib,Map;Interactive Form,,

",An end of project webinar is planned.,"A bi-lingual and interactive website has been produced which will act as an archive of art and protest in Iraq. See the full https://tishreen.org/ website.

This project was designed and implemented by Liwan, an Iraqi NGO, to create an archive of artwork and artist perspectives used in Iraq’s October 2019 protest movement. A contentious topic and one that will likely to be forgotten in the foreseeable future, those events in Baghdad and other cities witnessed hundreds of thousands of youth engage in demonstrations, which has been depicted by the production of a new body of artwork.

The project aims to create the first archive of its type, documenting art experiences and the artwork they have produced as a form of counter-narrative through an exploration of how the past and art is negotiated. The project interviewed artists to discuss new constructions of the past (and alternatives visions of the future) and promote non-sectarian narratives about Iraq. This project will tell an important part of Iraq’s recent history through cultural production related artwork that looks at the country’s cultural heritage and culture more generally.

This project aims to archive a version of the three-decade-long history of Kakuma Refugee Camp to show the forms of contradiction of temporariness. It does so by conducting interviews and storytelling sessions; collecting household memories; and capturing images/video.   The goal is to foster spaces of egalitarian participation in which residents can share stories and preserve aspects of their lives in dialogue, thus creating a web of conversations, documentation, and experience that would otherwise go ‘unarchived.’ Project outcomes include a documentary video, a scholarly article, a digital album, and ‘talking walls’—public exhibitions on camp buildings to challenge the transient logic that define the camp’s built infrastructures. The project also seeks to foster awareness among camp residents of the value of their experiences and change how the world at large perceives and responds to the asylum crisis. It is thus inward-and outward-looking. The other most important outcome will be regaining agency to produce and preserve knowledge and narratives about own experiences to shape global conversations about displacement in new ways.","The objectives of the project are in a sense twofold: on the one hand, to shift dominant narratives about the asylum crisis and perceptions of refugee camps as ephemeral spaces that so often go unarchived; on the other, to create a space for refugees to produce and preserve knowledge and narratives about their experiences to bring to local and global conversations about refuge, displacement, and asylum.

UFC0038,Multivocality and Egalitarian Representation of Slavery Heritage in Mikindani and Pangani Towns in Tanzania,Phase 1 Projects - Commissions (2021-2022),,UFC0038,,"The study explores howmultivocalityperpetuates dissonance that shape cultural negotiations and people’s means of coping with the violent memories. It uses evidences from 19thcentury major terminals of slavery caravan routes in Mikindani and Pangani in Tanzania as explorations for wider theoretical and practical questions related to slavery archives and provides useful insights for rethinking heritage representation approach and for dealing with cultural diversities. It also offers important insights in the flaws of authorised heritage discourse, making a strong case for the crucial role of multivocality and its tensions, in overcoming symbolic violence and creating understanding of “the other”.","The study adopts the lens of heritage dissonance and the IHD to explore the multivocality in the context of memorialization of heritage associated with the past slave trade, and how it perpetuates heritage dissonance that shapes cultural negotiations and the people’s means of coping with violent memories.

It applies qualitative constructivism, humanist and dissensus designs to explore diverse evidences from people’s construction of the slavery heritage. It specifically employs in-depth interviews, participatory-based FGDs and physical observation of slavery heritage sites.","The workshop for the co-creation of the narratives of slavery archival materials conducted in January (Pangani) and February (Mikindani), where the narrations are presented to the local communities in a participatory manner in order to reach consensus regarding the most egalitarian representation that tell a more diverse story of slavery heritage","Project set up (September 2021, Dar es Salaam)

It aims to consult a wide range of academic, archive stakeholders and local groups to ensure co-creation of an egalitarian archival practice and themes in post-conflict, reconstruction, and displacement contexts, and test its transferability, in promoting social cohesion. It is an opportunity for the team members to introduce the project to the wider community, different stakeholders, researchers, and potential commission applicants. To talk about the project and listen to them and scope what kind of activity(s) we could potentially fund and identify opportunities to set the research agenda in conjunction with local partners and groups. This will give the Imagining Futures team a substance to set up project commission calls. The first calls might go out early next year so there is still plenty of time to influence the agenda. So, the opportunity exists now to directly suggest archiving initiatives that address projects’ main goals and objectives. This workshop intends to elucidate and provoke any ideas from the participants—no matter how large or small—it would be of interest.

Through survival and legacy of colonialism in Mgao – an Imagining Futures funded project, the young generation in school were used to understand transgenerational memories of colonialism. A similar research was conducted between 1964 and 1973 by the University of Dar es Salaam history students which intended to document the Majimaji story. Tape recorders and field notes were used as research tools. These were deposited at the University of Dar es Salaam library-East Africana section in 1970’s, but tape recorders used in the 1960’s have evolved as the result the current devices are unable to read through the old tape. Technological obsoleteness is the problem that this project intends to deal with through digitization of the old to new version to insure longevity of data and online preservation.","The main objective of this project was to digitise oral interviews collected by the University of Dar es Salaam history students between 1960’s and 1970’s about the Majimaji War in order to preserve them for the future, to compare the 2020 interviews data of Mgao that documents memories of colonialism with those of the 1960’s-1970’s, to digitise field notes of the early history students of Tanzania in order to use them in areas where these archived oral traditions have disappeared, and finally is to analyse the recorded ways used to transfer memory of colonialism from one generation to another in order to establish the survival mechanism and legacy.","Archaeological Tourism Festival, Ruins, Clean Beaches and Fishing at Mgao Village, Mtwara, Tanzania: 19th September 2021

UFC0055,The Righteous Revolutionary,Start Up Projects (2020-2021),,,,"The project is mainly a production of a documentary film titled: The Righteous Revolutionary, based on the story of the Reverend Beyers Naude. 

Bearing the Cross of Resistance – a journey in search of justice in Apartheid South Africa

Beyers was both a public persona and a man who operated in the dark – a key member of the underground resistance to the Apartheid regime.

We are able to tell his story because his closest collaborator and confidant, Horst Kleinschmidt, has an incredible archive revealing the struggles Beyers faced, the decisions he made, the secret ways he communicated with others, both inside and outside of the country when Beyers himself was under banning orders and heavy surveillance.

The main objective is to bring to light an important phase of the struggle to overthrow Apartheid and to reflect on the relevance this has in contemporary times. The information that we have unearthed through the unique archives we are drawing on will be of significance not only in South Africa but globally, especially as it will explore the extensive links that were forged internationally, to defeat Apartheid.","We will be drawing on archival material in line with the specified confidentiality parameters that are already in place with those archive collections, as described in the accompanying statement by Hors Kleinschmidt.  

Participants will be approached to provide us with an in-depth interview to be able to better understand your historical contribution to this story. We have asked that they provide us with access to their personal memorabilia, photographs, newspaper articles, home recordings, and the like for integration into our filmed material.  We anticipate that the interview will roughly be of two to three hours duration. It is also possible that we will then come back to them at a later stage for a follow-up interview.

We will be approaching participants to share reflections and memories based on their own unique contact with Reverend Beyers Naude. We understand that such contact, at the time of the struggle to overthrow Apartheid, exposed the participants and others in the struggle to extreme personal risk and that some of the information they may wish to share may have been kept secret until now. We, therefore, encourage the participant to consider carefully what they are prepared to share.

The data collection will take place across many locations in South Africa, Including Cape town and Johannesburg. And at Stellenbosch University’s Beyers Naudé Centre for Public Theology (who have given written authorisation for us to film archive material they hold on Beyers Naudé).",I participated in the Imagining Futures Tanzania Lab Workshop hosted by Tumaini University Dar es Salaam College and willing to take part in the dissemination workshop at Mgao is planned by the Tanzania Lab,,,Horst Kleinschmidt; Mark Kaplan,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/the-righteous-revolutionary/,,not accessible to public,,,,,
UFC0056,The Role of Tanzanian Myths in Conservation of Natural Resources,Phase 1 Projects - Commissions (2021-2022),,UFC0056,,"Myth is one of the branches of oral literature that has been researched by several literary scholars. It is a very significant and supreme genre, which portrays the richness of the oral literature knowledge / indigenous knowledge. Myth fulfils in primitive culture an indispensable function: it expresses, enhances, and codifies belief; it safeguards and enforces morality; it guarantees for the efficiency of ritual and contains practical rules for the guidance of man. Myth is thus a vital ingredient in human existence and civilization. One of the roles of myth is to safeguard environment; natural resources, which is reflected in traditional and social practices that enforces rules and regulations of conserving natural environment. These include traditional beliefs, rituals and taboos. Myths consist of narratives that play a vital role of preserving environment in a traditional way. However, despite the fact that various scholars have dealt with myth, information of myth and environment conservation is limited. The project therefore, attempts to examine roles of Tanzanian Myths in safeguarding natural resources and archive this vital information.","The general objective of the project is to study and document the roles of Tanzanian Myths in safeguarding environment. To achieve the main objective, this project is specifically intending:

i. To identify myths that are environmentally friendly.

ii. To examine the influence of traditional beliefs and taboos in enforcing rules and regulations for environmental preservation

iii. To examine contribution of Tanzanian myths in conservation of natural resources.

The study will involve interview, site visitation whereby observations can take place and group discussion",,"Dodoma Region (Mpwapwa): 31st May – 14th June 2021 & 26th September – 2nd October 2021

The researchers visited Chimagai Dam, interviewed respondents about Sanga ya nzelu myth (Snake myth) and conducted focused group discussion. The researchers surveyed the area and observed the place where the former dam used to exist.

In Chimagai Dam, there was a huge snake that was believed to live in Chimagai Dam and it disappeared after the destruction of the Dam. The existence of the snake is related to the existence of water and the vegetation was green. The community respected the Sanga ya Nzelu snake dam because its presence made them fish, farm and perform religious and cultural rituals. They believed that the snake was a symbol of fertility, rebirth, healing and protection.

The disappearance of the snake led to drying up of the dam and environmental destruction. They believe that climate change is a result of not following the traditional rules that led to running away of the snake.

Mara region (Butiama); 27th June – 2nd July 2021

The researchers visited and surveyed a number of sites. Through the interviews, observation, and focused group discussion we revealed a number of environmental friendly myths including: Nyisawati, Nyakaseka and Nyanzabu Rivers, Bhitare water well and Mibango forest myths. These myths are connected to supernatural powers and community members respect them. For those who do not conform to taboos, traditional rules and regulations set by community elders are severely punished. These places are treated as sacred places where religious rituals and cultural practices are performed. Members are not supposed to anger the ancestors and spirits that live in forests, rivers, mountains or water wells. When the spirits are angered could appear in different forms; snake, aunt, bird, bee, wind or draught.

The respect and fear not to anger the ancestors and spirits, contribute to safeguarding natural resources in the community.

Butiama is observed to have frequent rainfall and green vegetation because of believing and respecting taboos and community traditional rules and regulations. This can be observed through the pictures.

Tanga region (Lushoto): 31st August – September 14th, 2021

The researchers visited and surveyed a number of sites such as Magamba, Malindi Chini, Malindi Juu, Maringo, Rangwi, Malindi Kibaoni villages and Kandee Kamphaa forest.

Interviews, focused group discussion and observations were the methods used to collect information.

The researchers revealed that the Mzuka myth is also connected to religious rituals and worship. The traditional believers believe that once the sacrifice is offered to the mizimu, people will not die of hunger or diseases, there will be plenty of rainfall and fertile land. They set their altars under the trees like mvumo, mkulo, mwandama, and mshai trees that no one is allowed to cut them because they are valuable to the community. Such trees, caves and rivers have been used for ritual purposes. People are not allowed to cut these sacred trees and dirty water sources and the vegetation around them. Those went against community norms were punished by gods/ancestors. From their beliefs in ancestors and spirit, natural resources are well-maintained.

Kandee Kamphaa myth

Kandee kamphaa myth has been transmitted orally from one generation to another more than three hundred years ago. The kandee kamphaa is believed to be a young girl; first born, who ran away from her parents and lived in the forest. She is usually seen at night and once someone recognizes her, she disappears. The girl used to live in one of the big tree that has a whole in it. The tree has been there ever since but it is now wearing out because of the parasitic plants, especially the mvumo plant.

The respondents revealed that the forest remained untouched because people feared the mysterious girl. Hence the forest remained thick and green. The community believes that this forest is a source of rain that contributes to fertile land. The two myths are environmentally friendly as they contribute to the conservation of natural resources; forests and water sources.

Rain-making myth-Lushoto, Mpwapwa and Butiama

This myth exists in all studied regions. It is connected to the ancestors’ anger. Sacrifice has to be given to the ancestors for rain to fall. It involves blood shading: goat, sheep or cow. The respected elders perform the rituals. The rainfall is followed by thanksgiving to the elders who performed the rainfall rituals.

Traditional beliefs and taboos that enforce rules and regulations for natural resources conservation.

Generally, Natural resources are connected to religious rituals, hence the respect of the altars contributes to preservation of natural resources:

Community members not to be allowed to go into forest with axe or machete
Not to destruct waters sources-unclean pots
Taking bath or washing clothes around the water sources
Physical punishment
Taking resources such as cow, goat, etc.
The taboos create fear and stop people from destruction of natural resources.
Conclusion

Myths in all researched regions, are constructed to safeguarding the environment. Its structure is connected to natural environment; trees, ponds, lakes, mountains, stones and animals. They are all connected to spiritual beings and traditions of a certain community. It is this connection that makes the society to be concerned on safeguarding the natural resources. Therefore, there is significant contribution of myths to conservation of natural resources

The study revealed also that there are environmental taboos and traditional regulations that are intended for the ethical use of the environment. They help keep people away from further destructing the environment. The Tanzanian people therefore, have a rich indigenous knowledge system which if used wisely may help in environmental conservation.

UFC0060,Tracing Nubian Archives through time in Kenya & in the U.K.,Phase 1 Projects - Commissions (2021-2022),,UFC0060,,"Tracing Nubian Archives is an intergenerational, cross cultural project that uses African archival practices to engage with the Nubian community in Kenya.  The project works with Nubian objects held in U.K. museums, Kenyan landscapes (including WW1 battlefields), Nubian elder archives and oral histories to develop a flexible Nubian archive that tells the story of their rich cultural history and resilience in the face of land right and citizenship injustice. The project engages with the ongoing lands court case the Nubian community in Kibos is involved in, following their unlawful forced eviction during the COVID-19 pandemic. By bringing together Nubian history from the static British archives and the dynamic Kenyan archives – Tracing Nubian Archives uses film, community gatherings and digital repatriation to share their story both within their community and with the wider public. It serves both as a community record and a counter to their story’s previous erasure. ","The project team are going to develop a series of films (with documentation where appropriate) for distribution online and also via WhatsApp. The deliberate use of WhatsApp is because its widespread use as a tool allows for the inclusion of people who have been displaced and/ or marginalised. Information is easily shared both locally and internationally and the features of WhatsApp allow it to both broadcast and be a site of conversation through the groups feature. The documents feature allows for the development of an ongoing flexible archive that is accessible to a wide range of people. The process of developing the films is part of the archival practice as it will necessitate the dialogues indicated above while capturing the archives that are emerging through the ongoing land court case.  

The films will feature 

Documentation of the ongoing land case in Kibos 
A history of Nubian peoples pertaining to their context in Kenya 
Rich Nubian material cultural heritage through their craft practice – these videos will also include an instructional set for younger Nubian community members 
The process of digital repatriation of Nubian collections from the UK 
Oral history with Nubian elders 
Landscape archival work through visits to key sites 
Multiple dialogues as detailed in the Venn diagram showing the overlapping experience 
The films will feature several Kenyan languages including Kinubi, Kiswahili, Sheng and English. It is important to note that even though there will be use of subtitles – not all the conversations will be fully translated. The project works to reflect and meet the needs of Nubian communities while working to educate the wider public.","The following are the activities have been undertaken by the Tracing Nubian Archive research team.

Kibos land case: attending court hearings and site visits – May & July 2021
Two craft workshops:
One on artifacts where an elderly woman showed 4 youths how to use a cooking pan called sasi kisira, used for cooking Nubian cuisine by the name kisira;
One on beads making called suksuk with an elderly man mentoring 4 youths.
1-2-1 consultation – the team have conducted 24 interviews with Nubian elders and youths to get their context on Nubian history.
Community craft workshop – 18th October 2021 at Mchanganyiko hall in Kibera salama location, with 25 community members
World war 1 visits – In October 2021 the Project Team visited the Voi war cemetery, the Maktau Indian cemetery, the Taveta military cemetery, the Indian memorial and Salaita Hill.",,,JC Niala,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/tracing-nubian-archives-through-time-in-kenya-and-uk/,,accessible to public,,,,,
UFC0061,Traditional storytelling as an archive under threat,Phase 1 Projects - Commissions (2021-2022),,UFC0061,,"The contextual and historical influences on storytelling and story taking are critical features of the African oral tradition that are often ignored or minimized in African history and as a form of archive. African societies have been using stories as a form of education and a tool to impart knowledge to youngsters. After the day’s work, mostly evening children would gather around the fireplace and an elder—grandfather or grandmother—would tell a story or a riddle or sing a song with the children. Stories are the foundation of African traditional knowledge. Despite the complex and often contentious history of African storytelling, their oral traditions have not been explored to reveal the depth of their lived experiences and the way those experiences and knowledge inform the community and how it archives the society’s culture.","The objectives of the study included:

Children understanding on traditional story telling as one of the archives that is under threat.
Education officers supports traditional storytelling in curriculum preparations and practices.
To know whether teachers, guardians/parents nurture their children towards the use of traditional storytelling.
To comprehensively document and digitise stories, riddles and folktales from selected primary school children in Dar es Salaam.
The methodology of the study is qualitative approach with detailed interviews and focus group discussions.","Storytelling is primarily a foundation of qualitative research.  It is a method rooted in oral traditions.  The study purposely sampled 3 public schools – Msasani B primary school, Mikocheni primary school and Ushindi primary school in Kinondoni district, Dar es Salaam Tanzania.   The methodology in this study included detailed interviews and Focus Group discussions with teachers, Education Officers, parents and pupils.  Pupils were allowed to retell their stories, songs and/or riddles that they may have learnt either from their parents or guardians and/or teachers.

UFC0065,Yarmouk Camp: A Story Unfolded,Start Up Projects (2020-2021),,UFC0065,,"Eight kilometers south of Damascus city center located Yarmouk camp, the biggest unofficial Palestinian refugee camp comparing to 12 others in Syria and 68 camps in the Middle East. There are disputed sources regarding the number of people living there, However, in some estimations, the camp is argued to have about 600.000 people.

Today the camp stands empty after being massively destroyed between 2013 and 2018. After 2018 the Syrian government has indicated that Palestine refugees will be allowed to return to the camp in the future. The procrastination by the Syrian government continued till June 2020 when Damascus municipality announced the approval of the new masterplan Nr. 105 of Yarmouk camp.

The municipality prepared an evaluation plan for the status of the building, on which it proposes that only 40% of the building could be reused while 60% of the camp area has to be razed to the ground and rebuilt according to the new Masterplan. The plan ignored the core identity of the camp erasing some of the main streets that shaped the memory of the camp and represented the main economic veins and gathering points for its communities. 

Over 10,000 objections were submitted by the former inhabitants, Palestinian organisations, and civil communities, forcing Damascus municipality to put the plan on hold in September 2020. 

There is a need to shift the discussion over the Yarmouk camp from the technicality of the master plan and reconstruction towards more empathy and understanding of the importance of the camp as an essential component to the memory of both Palestinians and Syrians in Damascus city. Yarmouk is not only a refugee camp as perceived by many, rather than a historical milestone of the social cohesion between Syrians and Palestinians over 50 years of living together. This camp formed an incubator of interactions and co-existence between various communities.","The project aims at telling the story of Yarmouk Camp, the biggest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and the middle east. The storytelling approach aims to present the memory of this camp from a different perspective. A data-driven story by providing information about the history and development of this camp since its existence; a policy-driven story that is based on the policy issues regarding its reconstructing after the conflict in Syria, and an art-based story where artists will archive their memories about this camp through their lenses. The project aims to explore the level of engagement by urbanists, artists, and activists in the discourses of memory in Syrian cities and neighborhoods that are under threat of removal due to the so-called reconstruction. The project will form a baseline for a broader engagement on a regional level.","Raising awareness explainer (Graphics Interchange Format) to introduce Al-Yarmouk camp and shed light on its history, which role it had in Damascus city, and a briefing of the recently proposed reconstruction policies concerning it.
Webinar on the memory of Yarmouk and the current challenges. This webinar will host members of Syrian organisations and urban activists as well as artists to share experiences and concepts about the memory Yarmouk and discuss collectively what is crucial, important, and relevant to preserve the identity of this camp. The webinar will be held online after the publication of the GIF. 
Competition of Pop-Art graphics: will be announced by the end of the webinar. The competition will be held online to submit one piece of Pop-Art graphics that captures one or more elements of the Yarmouk memory. The competition will take place over 6 weeks. A jury of 3 members and the Syrbanism team will evaluate the submitted works. There will be a symbolic financial prize for the winner.

Additionally, this project explores the material items migrants bring, their function and meaning to them - the stories ‘objects’ hold. Furthermore, adding to a vocabulary that refuses the colonial hierarchies and ordering of knowledge, the project seeks to engage artists in Zimbabwe as collaborators, including their interactions with diaspora in the creation of archival representations; recognising their ability to ‘archive’ through capture - the affective dimensions of ‘return’ using different forms of creative expression.","To explore alternative ways of archival practice To understand the circulation of materialities, the knowledge that they produce and meanings associated To establish how artwork and craft is shaped by diasporic movements and requirements Qualitative approach, we intend to carry out interviews with Zimbabwean healthcare workers in Britain as well as Zimbabwean artists engaged in the construction of materials that represent ‘return’. Collating the narratives and practices that locate the “things” in everyday cultural practice, revealing the life of “objects” outside the archive as a static space of storage and documentation, thus “enlivening” objects.

The study will cover the affective character and relational qualities of the songs (Baker and Collins 2016; Samuel 1994), motivations of composers, circumstances under which the songs were made, the meaning and functions of the songs, the contexts in which the songs function, and how the songs have been preserved and passed on. Our goal is to understand how such songs promote peace and social harmony and engender social justice. Based on the assumption that songs are archival and are subjects of heritage preservation, we shall work with locally acclaimed songsters in Jamestown, a heterogeneous settlement in Accra, Ghana. The study will offer us the opportunity to become familiar with the social environment in which we will undertake our “Imagining Ghanaian Futures” project and to identify challenges that may confront us in the course of the project. Lessons we shall learn from the project will enable us to fine-tune our approaches to un/archiving information relating to conflict management and peacebuilding in Ghana. We expect the results of this study to enhance our understanding of how knowledge is created, shaped, owned, disseminated, and preserved through song.","In this project, we seek to document and develop a digital inventory of age-old sacred, secular and ceremonial vernacular songs as archives of public history and study how such songs promote peace and social harmony and engender social justice.

We shall approach our study with the assumption that songs are archival and are subjects of heritage preservation. Songs, like music, will be seen as media of codifying, archiving, and disseminating information on valuable elements of public history (Long et al 2018) and as a means by which people negotiate and renegotiate their daily lives.

UFC0072,Futures Through Underwater Pasts: the Search for Mongalo,,,UFC0072,,"The Futures Through Underwater Pasts: the Search for Mongalo is a project funded by a grant from the AHRC Network Plus Rising from the Depth Sites. This project aims to combine two Network Plus groups, the maritime archaeology of Rising from the Depths with the memory research of Imagining Futures.

It searches for sites that were directly involved in 16th -18th-century slavery and the aftermaths of this trade are hardly discussed in the written sources and historiography of East Africa. Futures through underwater pasts and the search for Mongalo is a project which intends to document the unexplored legacies of the European trade networks in the southern coast of Tanzania particularly the interaction between the French, Portuguese, and British on the coast of Mongalo (Mgao). The French interest in Mongalo began in 1784 when the French government wanted to extend the sphere of its commercial trading in the Indian Ocean and especially from Muscat to East Africa. Governor Souillac was asked to look for a shipowner willing to go to Mongalo (Mgao) with his ships to explore and establish a French presence. This was when Nicolas Comarmond offered and was chosen. This project intends to complement the historical documents with offshore and onshore maritime evidence from the site of Mongalo (Mgao) and the transgenerational memories of the slave trade on the southern coast of Tanzania. 

The site of Mongalo (Mgao) contributes to the debate about what happened as the aftermath of slavery to slaves and their descendants in the southern coast of East Africa, their marginality, mobility, social and political legacies in the present. The project combines archaeological and historical methods to understand the site history as a window to address the economic development of the people of Mongalo (Mgao). This is a pioneering project for the site of Mongalo (Mgao) which has never received archaeological attention even though a multibillion cement company was established in 2015 in the proximity of the site and the construction of a port that will utilize the same maritime route for export and imports of goods is underway.","This project key aim is to search for Mongalo to increase the mobility of ideas (and people) around the knowledge of the French slave trade sites in East Africa and to facilitate a network of partnership along the East African Coast in this case Mtwara and the Islands in the Indian Ocean such as Mauritius.  The connection between Mauritius and Mongalo was already realized in 1784 when Nicolas Comarmond was chosen to explore Muscat and the East African Indian Ocean. 

Key aims are establishing the extent of the site and documenting the materiality and intangible aspects of the site, reconnoitering people’s memories of the site and its French slave trade connection to answer the question about the legacies of the French Slave Trade in Tanzania. Historians of the East Africa slave trade such as Alpers (1967), mention Mongalo as an important trading centre. Slaves who were sold in Mombasa and as far as Mauritius traced their home from Mongalo. However, the exact location of this important centre is yet to be revealed. Archaeologists of the southern coast of Tanzania such as Pollard and Ichumbaki (2017) emphasize Mingoyo which is in the Lindi region to be the French station mainly because of the remains of fortification and an abandoned jetty. Using geographical, linguistics, and archaeological evidence, this project intends to establish the exact location of Mongalo by exploring the village of Mgao which marks a maritime border between Lindi and Mtwara.","Terrestrial fieldwork: October 2020
Underwater fieldwork: TBD","The Futures through Underwater Pasts have been carrying out fieldwork and surveys in Mgao where they have conducted a tide survey as well as an excavation where they found 16th-17th century beads as well as observing the ruins at Mgao, associated with the French Slave Trade in Tanzania.",,Nancy Rushohora,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/futures-through-underwater-pasts-the-search-for-mongalo/,,accessible to public,,,,,
