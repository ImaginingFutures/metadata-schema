UFC0001,Yucatan to Living and archiving Sotuta’s foodways,Phase 2 Projects - Commissions (Sep 2022-Sep 2023),Central and South America,UFC0001_Yucatan_to_living_and_archiving_Satutas_foodways.jpg,,"Our project integrated archiving into the everyday life of Sotuta, a Maya community in Yucatan, Mexico. Over a year, fourteen residents, almost all women from a wide age range, documented the foodways of the town, involving their family members, friends, and neighbours. Each chose the topic they would document, which included medicinal and culinary recipes, kitchen gardens, the wilderness, the relationship between humans and plants and animals, agricultural practices, festivities and traditions, and memories of past life experiences, among others. Together, they collected over 4000 images, videos, and handwritten documents, they restored a mural documenting Sotuta’s embroiderers, cross-stitched calendars, embroidered memory journals, and hand sewed dolls. They created the multimedia archive by incorporating their record collection into their routines. That is, they integrated self-archiving into their life, firmly positioning themselves as historical actors through the quiet processes of the everyday. Through regular meetings, community workshops, and an exhibition, in partnership with with local grassroots project Cultiva Alternativas de Regeneración, Solares Huertas Agroforestales, and Comunidad escuela campesina de agricultura regenerativa y agroforestería Maya, we also created spaces of intergenerational tsikbal, intimate dialogue, to share experiences, records, memories, and emotions, reinforcing collective memory. With this, the project intertwined the tangible with the intangible. Living and archiving Sotuta’s foodways has helped revitalise sustainable practices for food sovereignty and the defence of Maya identity, memory, territory, and ways of living.",,Olin Moctezuma Burns,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/animating-cycles-for-living-and-archiving-the-foodways-of-a-maya-community-in-yucatan/,,accessible to public,,,,,

This project draws on approaches in contemporary archaeology to witness and document COVID-19 materiality – posters, signage, murals, graffiti, discarded personal protective equipment, disinfection paraphernalia, barricades – on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam through photographs and sketches to create a fully accessible online archive of COVID-19 heritage. The project is timely. As lockdowns fade from memory, debates are ongoing as to how the extraordinary period of pandemic will be remembered. Meanwhile, material traces of pandemic are beginning to disappear as daily life resumes under ‘new normal’ conditions. Our research seizes the opportunity not only to create an open access archive of COVID-19 heritage but to test the extent to which material perspectives in research on disasters can improve understandings of the relationships between public action and government policies.",,Rachel Anne Tough,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/archiving-covid-19-heritage-in-ho-chi-minh-city/,,accessible to public,,,,,

In this project, we intend to collect data (audio-visual) on food and hospitality rituals that are unique to multiple regional and ethnic groups in Syria that are usually under-represented, misrepresented, or altogether excluded in mainstream media and culture in Syria. The findings will be archived creatively and shared online, and they will inform the writing of a unique Syrian recipe book with a cultural twist. Each entry in the book will include recipes, a historical and cultural background about the dish and the specific social group associated with it, and a narration of any rituals associated with the dish or to this particular group and food.
The mapping out of the research field has already started by the research assistant in Syria so that when the project starts officially in April she will have a clear idea about which cultural groups to focus on and which participants she’d like to interview and film.
Simultaneously, the lead researcher in Exeter will be creating a literature review of scholarly work and studies around food and culture, and then when both this and the data collection in Syria end, he will start writing the cultural recipe book and aim to finish it in September.",,Aqeel Abdulla,,https://imaginingfutures.world/projects/food-hospitality-and-the-micro-cultures-of-syria/,,accessible to public,Discover the book with the interactive map;Send your own recipe,https://create.ifrepo.world/exhibits/syria_recipes_and_cultures;https://create.ifrepo.world/exhibits/syria_recipes_and_cultures/contrib,Map;Interactive Form,,

The project engages with the ongoing lands court case the Nubian community in Kibos is involved in, following their unlawful forced eviction during the COVID-19 pandemic. By bringing together Nubian history from the static British archives and the dynamic Kenyan archives – Tracing Nubian Archives uses film, community gatherings and digital repatriation to share their story both within their community and with the wider public.

The study will cover the affective character and relational qualities of the songs (Baker and Collins 2016; Samuel 1994), motivations of composers, circumstances under which the songs were made, the meaning and functions of the songs, the contexts in which the songs function, and how the songs have been preserved and passed on. Our goal is to understand how such songs promote peace and social harmony and engender social justice. Based on the assumption that songs are archival and are subjects of heritage preservation, we shall work with locally acclaimed songsters in Jamestown, a heterogeneous settlement in Accra, Ghana. The study will offer us the opportunity to become familiar with the social environment in which we will undertake our “Imagining Ghanaian Futures” project and to identify challenges that may confront us in the course of the project. Lessons we shall learn from the project will enable us to fine-tune our approaches to un/archiving information relating to conflict management and peacebuilding in Ghana.
