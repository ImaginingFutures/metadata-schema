IF-LAB-0001,"Baddawi Camp Lab, Lebanon",,IF-LAB-0001,,,"<h2>Synopsis and Position</h2>
The Baddawi Camp Lab approaches egalitarian archiving practice through developing the hosts’ existing engagement with ruination (Qasmiyeh 2019) and rhizoanalysis (Fiddian-Qasmiyeh 2019a/b) and building on materials shared with the Tanzania Lab team. The Lab provides opportunities to reflect on a series of historical, social and conceptual connections between Baddawi Camp and some of the themes and sites explored by the Tanzania Team, especially with regards to forms of archiving multiple narratives and sites of remembrance. This has already been explored following a pilot visit in July 2019, with a number of gatherings and creative writing workshops scheduled for 2021-2022. With a view to building synergies with the Tanzanian sites, the Baddawi Camp Lab will facilitate 3 intersecting case-studies: 1) Travelling and stagnant ruination in the colonial prisons in Tanzania and the UNRWA and PLO and bomb shelters in Baddawi Camp, 2) Tracing the multiple past, present and (imagined) future connections between Baddawi Camp and diverse people and places from different regions of Africa, 3) Trauma and Space in Baddawi Camp. These cases act as catalysts to building our approach for a cross-context methodology for egalitarian archiving and testing its transferability across sites and moments, and is important for the Lab in order to prioritise modes of what we can term ‘South-South engagement’. <br />

<h2>Objectives and Methods</h2>
The lab seeks to: 
<ol>
        <li>Understand the traveling and stagnant ruination in the colonial prisons in Tanzania and the UNRWA and PLO and bomb shelters in Baddawi Camp through interviews, oral histories, (popular and institutional) archival analysis, creative writing, and photography. This case-study will examine the past, present and futures/legacies of the UNRWA and PLO bomb shelters in Baddawi Camp, placing them into conversation with the team’s analysis of colonial prisons in Tanzania. We are particularly interested in how these sites (shelters and prisons) have been transformed into places of ruination whereby pasts and presents continuously meet and diverge as they ponder their respective futures. </li>
        <li>Our second case-study focuses on the area of the Upper Camp where the UNRWA schools (and hence bomb shelters) are situated, and which is also Hay al-Muhajarin: the neighbourhood which is home to Palestinians of African descent who were displaced (mainly from al-Nabatieh Camp) to Baddawi Camp in the 1970s. This case study explores the multiple past, present, and (imagined) future connections between Baddawi Camp and diverse people and places from different regions of Africa. It is widely acknowledged that Afro-Palestinians/Black Palestinians are a particularly under-researched group of Palestinians (writ large and including in Lebanon), and this case-study will ensure that the diverse constituents of the camp and/as archive are at the forefront of our analysis. A further link with Africa, and specifically with Tanzania, is its role in hosting Palestinian intellectuals and leaders in exile from the 1960s. In this case study, we, therefore, aim to engage critically with the ways that displacement inheres other displacements by focusing on multiple and overlapping histories.</li>
        <li>Trauma and Space in Baddawi Camp. This case-study relates to the Tanzanian team’s reference from their pilot to the “trauma-filled abandoned cotton fields” and explores how and why certain spaces historically associated with violence and trauma have come to form the foundations of the contemporary refugee camp and its neighbouring area (Jebel al-Baddawi). In addition to the UNRWA and PLO bomb shelters, we will examine how liminal spaces on the threshold of the camp – such as the Zeitun (olive) groves, Jebel (hill/mountain) groves, and football pitches – have been transformed by both Palestinian and Lebanese publics into old-new spaces of memory and imagined futures.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
Selected Recent praise for Eating the Archive: 

<ul>
    <li>Eating The Archive by Yousif M. Qasmiyeh is a poetic counter-archive of the refugee camp. It visibilises what is otherwise rendered invisible in the official archives. Qasmiyeh’s poems “can see,” emerging powerfully from prolonged waiting in the camp, where “waiting is seeing”. This important book is an invitation to think in the cracks of the walls, where cracks and the spaces of in-betweenness are also witnesses for wounded names and faces – a space where the poet can breathe in his mother tongue by breathing with his mother. Eating The Archive is an open gateway to encounter the camp that is lost in conventional ethnographic observations and fieldwork. </li>
</ul>
   — Shahram Khosravi, ‘Illegal’ Traveller<br />
 
<ul>
    <li>In Eating the Archive, Yousif M. Qasmiyeh offers object lessons on what is — and isn’t — graspable: a photograph, a frying pan, a gun, language, time, prayer, a mirror, a razor, a divination bowl. Who is the author of the archive? The poet bears witness, to what lives and dies right in front of him, and inside him. He does this by writing, 'a trace still as it is still.' To read Yousif M. Qasmiyeh is to step into a caesura: a place where presence and absence engage with attention; a place where erasure speaks back; a camp of voices that refuse to be forgotten or silent.</li>
</ul>
   — Pádraig Ó Tuama, Poetry Unbound<br />
 
<ul>
    <li>Federico Garcia Lorca suggested that every poet has a wound, but what if, as Yousif M. Qasmiyeh writes in his new book Eating the Archive, ‘the wound is continuously postponed’? Enter memory lodged with shrapnel, where to view anything culminates in breathing through time that ‘cuts through words’. This vast and beautifully parablesque second collection by Qasmiyeh is a poetics of rupture, of cracks and fissures. Here we find a writer so philosophically alert to the crossing of danger that is ‘experience’. With a knack for echolalic narrative, Qasmiyeh is able to both fragment and distil time, looping back to remember and re-remember what happened to the author and his family from their time in Lebanon’s Baddawi refugee camp. Eating the Archive offers us a densely physical consideration of language—the difficulties of writing to name anything that comes from the archive of mind and body through to the ‘limb of a word’—where writing itself is risk. Qasmiyeh is one of the most exciting new writers of the twenty-first century.</li>
</ul>
— James Byrne, Of Breaking Glass<br />
 
<ul>
    <li>Qasmiyeh’s camp is a space for reckoning. In his poems, home is a tomb and the present is situated in the afterlife of history, as he calls it, where there is “No one to question our dying. No one to shed a tear for what is happening behind walls. Thin, flawed walls built for the temporary in mind.” The field some have begun to call the literature of displacement is where the world’s most important writing is taking place and Qasmiyeh’s second collection confirms that he is one of its brightest rising talents.</li>

    <li>Yousif M. Qasmiyeh: One of the poems written as part of this year’s work on the Baddawi Camp Lab, ‘The Camp is a Bait for Time,’ was nominated by the editor of the literary journal in which it first appeared, for the 2023 Forward Prize.</li>

IF-LAB-0002,"Beirut, Lebanon",,IF-LAB-0002,,,"<h2>Synopsis and Position</h2>
As part of the Imagining Futures project, the Beirut Urban Lab at the American University of Beirut will house the Beirut Lab, a lab that will interrogate the methods and strategies in which Beirut has been archived and unarchived. This comes with the understanding of the city as a complex, dynamic process of archiving and unarchiving; a contested entity with an open process of multiple realities, narratives and futures. The lab further explores how moments of disruption trigger the unarchiving of the city towards an imagined future.<br />
<br />
The unfolding of recent events since October 2019 has called for the rethinking the city as an archive, archiving the city, and imagined as un-archiving the city. The October 17th Revolution pushed people onto the streets of central Beirut, reclaiming expropriated structures and reinitiating socio-spatial practices. The collapse of the Lebanese economy, the devaluation of the national currency and the spread of Covid-19 throughout the spring brought social and economic life in the city to an end and plunged large sections of Lebanon’s population into poverty. On August 4th, a stockpile of ammonium nitrate precariously stored at the Beirut Port for 6 years exploded with the ferocity of small atomic bomb, shattering entire neighborhoods and upending countless lives.<br />
<br />
As part of the Beirut Urban Lab’s response to these events, the Beirut Lab will explore how different conceptions of reconstruction and recovery can function as processes of unarchiving. It looks at the public as an agency of imagining the future through socio-spatial tactics of the revolution after October 2019 and then through the oral narratives crafted for the future of a recovery after the Port’s blast.

<h2>Objectives and Methods</h2>
The lab explores post-disaster relief as a producer of archives, moments of disruptions as un-archiving processes, and reconstructions as methods of unarchiving multiple imaginaries using the perception of heritage across time as a primary frame. The Beirut lab’s objective is to A) Uncover, document, archive and unarchive social, physical and intangible histories of Beirut. B) To read through maps and masterplans not only as tools of urban change, but as systems that deconstruct the dichotomy between the organization of territory, and the potential for geographic and social rupture. C) To analyze the production of space on an urban level, or the lack thereof, by studying the strategies and methods through which the state attempted to plan Beirut, and subsequently failed. D) To visualize alternative urban histories and to present new historical and social readings of Beirut’s urban form, it’s architectural ‘landmarks’ and the diverse practices of its inhabitants. E) The lab will also present critical readings of the agency and methodologies behind various Beiruti reconstructions; from the Solidere project, to Beit Beirut, to the anticipated, and imagined, reconstruction and recovery of the Bachoura, Gemmayze, Mar Mikhael, Karantina and Ain Mreisse following the August 4 explosion. <br />
<br />
The lab will rely on visualization and mapping, analysing public and cultural centers archives of the city, and developing the Levant carta platform as the main research tools.

IF-LAB-0003,The London Lab,,IF-LAB-0003,,"Scanathon Dig - Playgrounds;Prisoners of Love: Affect, containment and alternative futures","<h2>Synopsis and Position</h2>The mobile virtual London Lab is a collaboration between CSM, with colleagues Mick Finch, Louisa Minkin and Elizabeth Wright, and the Endangered Material Knowledge Programme at the British Museum, led by Ceri Ashley (also of the University of Pretoria, S. Africa). It pools expertise and a network of knowledge, supporting the 4 context- Labs and the commissioning stage. It will focus on provision of digital toolkits and skill-sharing through non-hierarchical forms, grassroots production, using free/libre open-source software (FLOSS), with the intention of developing new contexts and associations and strategies for egalitarian archiving practice, enabling new self-representations and re-reading or counter-mapping of existing archival material. It will include such digital practices as: Mazi Raspberry Pi technology (low cost hyper local networking for community self-representation), film auto-documentation and ELAN software for annotations, and a suite of open source solutions for photogrammetric capture and post-processing. The emphasis will be on digital recording/capture of sites, places, landscape and 3D objects and surfaces, and the intersection of these with lived and re-lived memories and futurities – tools of both production and dissemination. It aims to enable events that will experiment with a set of media familiar in art schools: video, sound, animation, 3D structure from motion photogrammetry and geo-spatial applications but also in terms of the use of analogue media; and interfaces with EMKP’s proven record of supporting research in digital/visual ethnography, audio-visual creation, innovative and reflexive metadata organisation, multi-layered annotation, safeguarding, situational ethics and intellectual property rights, the practicalities of digital holding and access curation. Prior work project partners’ work includes re-tooling colonial and historic photographic and object archives held in museums through repatriation to source communities and working with knowledge holders of the Blackfoot Confederacy concerning their objects in UK collections. Through such interventions, older hieratic understandings and appropriation of knowledge becomes re-purposed for new engagements and archival creation. Existing knowledge structures, whether local to ODA- countries or existing skills of London team-members, are starting points for collective sharing and knowledge development.<br />
<h2>Objectives and Methods</h2>We have met with several of the Labs and are hoping to have met them all by the end of 2020.  The Lab is establishing dialogue to explore the specificities of each Lab, their methods, technologies and the challenges they are encountering during COVID 19. The Lab is working on a case study with the community of an adventure playground in London in the production of a mural.  An older mural will be archived and the production of the new mural documented toward the production of toolkits that relate to both digital and analogue processes. The aim here is develop strategies that respond to the contexts of the Labs in terms of pragmatic encounters, as examples to work with the Labs as their projects unfold. <br />
<h2>Workshops and Events</h2>As soon as we have the material from our case study we will lead an event on its material, insights and outcomes that we will present to our colleagues in Imagining Futures. We are aiming for December 2020 for this event.<br />
<h2>Activities</h2>Development of case studies in response to the Lab’s specificities.
Development of analogue and digital toolkits of developing new contexts and associations and strategies for egalitarian archiving practice

Overall, Ghana Lab has been able to gather formally and informally archived information that humanities research often glosses over and to expose archiving processes that reflect multiple co- existing experiences and memorialisation of value and relevance. Notwithstanding variations that exist, trends that are common to the three settlements are outlined below:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Songs, performances, communal celebrations, monuments, names, photographs, stories, proverbs and the landscape are key media through which people of the settlements studied conserve and transmit information about the past they choose to keep and use to guide their present and to inform their futures.</li>
    <li>The archived past is an instrument for managing trauma, fostering social cohesion and peaceful relations and for maintaining the fabric of society.</li>
    <li>Various communities bonded by kinship, profession, spirituality, social status, and gender deliberately choose aspects of the past and present they wish to remember and conserve or disremember based on changing life circumstances and interests.</li>
    <li>Heterogeneity of the settlements make nonsense of tribalism and ethnicity.</li>
