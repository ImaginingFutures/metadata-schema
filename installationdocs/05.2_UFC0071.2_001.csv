UFC0071.2.0001,,Archiving the architecture of buildings and housing in Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei settlement areas,A mosque in Kakuma,,UFC0071b0001.jpg,,,"Constructed in the year 2013, it would be slightly hard to tell the functionality of this structure by a mere look. However, a close look at the far end of the top right corner of the roof you notice a loudspeaker, an obvious sight of a Mosque in Kakuma which is used to call the muslim for prayers. The construction of this mosque was funded by the Turkish government for the minority group of Congolese and Burundian Muslims in Kakuma Camp. The walls, clearly cracked due to splash of rain water, are made of mud bricks, a common building material in Kakuma because of its easy availabilty. The beautiful white and green colors painted on the walls are said to be of a significance to the Muslim faith  with the white color refecting the hot sun rays and the green symbolizing unity in islamic faith.",,,,Photography,Mosque;Religion;Architecture,Address info is only for testing,Kenya;Turkana;Kakuma Camp 1,country;region;address,"[3.7473960128726893, 34.83724925426057]",,,,,,,2013,,,Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim,Creative Commons BY-NC-SA,,,,accessible to public,,Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim,,contributor
UFC0071.2.0002,,Archiving the architecture of buildings and housing in Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei settlement areas,Madarasa,,UFC0071b0002a.jpg;UFC0071b0002b.jpg;UFC0071b0002c.jpg,,,"These are photos of a Madarasa, a religious class used by Islam to teach Islamic faith to young Muslim kids as a foundation. 
To understand the Holy Quran, one needs to learn the Arabic language which is the original text the Holy Quran is written with, thus kids at their younger age are taught to read and write Arabic while reciting verses of the Quran. Therefore, the chalkboards are used for teaching the children by the local Islam teachers who have advanced their understanding of the Holy Book and are also able to proficiently read and write in Arabic.The photos display the exterior and interior structure of the Madarasa. From the interior, the floor is covered with a mat that provides children with a great deal of comfort when sitting than chairs, which take up a large space with less space for kids to play during a short break.
Due to the unfavorable climate in the Kakuma region, the rooms consist of big windows that are positioned sideways to allow cool air to enter for easy ventilation of the rooms.
The exterior is a photo of two attached rooms built in a modern style with large windows for a conducive environment. One class is both a store and the teacher’s quarter where administration works are done while the other one is the class where learning takes place. 
The structure above was constructed in May 2013 and the significance of archiving it is bonded to its location, wherein, the seasonal river (lagga) is expected to wash it away in a couple of years or so if proper measures such as building gabions are not undertaken.",,,,Photography,,Address info is only for testing,Kenya;Turkana;Kakuma Camp 1,country;region;address,"[3.7423960128726893, 34.83524925426057]",,,,,,,2013-05,,,Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim,Creative Commons BY-NC-SA,,,,accessible to public,,Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim,,contributor
UFC0071.2.0003,,Archiving the architecture of buildings and housing in Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei settlement areas,Barren,,UFC0071b0003.jpg,,,"The security concerns between Camp 1&2 have been catastrophic for a long period. The distance between the two camps is inhabitable mostly covered by a thick thorny forest. As a result, this building, nestled within the barren expanse of Kakuma Camp is a testament to the humanitarian efforts of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). The LWF's initiative, dating back to 2005, has been essential in safeguarding not only the lives of the residents but also the security of vehicles and motorcycles navigating through the camp, thereby contributing significantly to the safety and security of the residents of Kakuma for a decade. Constructed from durable concrete bricks, the building stands as a testament to meticulous planning and engineering prowess. The choice of materials reflects a strategic response to the challenging climatic conditions prevalent in the region, including relentless winds and heavy rainfall. However, today no one understands why the roof of the building was taken off with no security activities for the last couple of years. Could it be that the security concern has capsized or the project ended?",,,,Photography,,Address info is only for testing,"Kenya;Turkana;Kakuma Camp 1, Barrens",country;region;address,"[3.7453960128726893, 34.83124925426057]",,,,,,,2005,,,Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim,Creative Commons BY-NC-SA,,,,accessible to public,,Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim,,contributor
